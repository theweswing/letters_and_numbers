# Letters & Numbers

An attempt at a daily quiz game (ala Wordle) using the format of the BBC show "Countdown"

# Letters:

Each day, users are presented with a set of letters.

In a set time interval, users make the longest valid dictionary word they can.

After finishing, they are presented with other possible words, the average user's score that day, and how common their word was.

Your "score" is simply how long your word was.

Ex:
[T, I, Y, I, D, R, P, L, I]
My answer was "TRIP" a 4.
After answering, I would see that other answers included: dirtily (7), tidily(6), triply(6), etc.
And I would see that x% of users answered TRIP, where my score placed on average today, etc.

# Numbers:

Each day, users are presented with a set of numbers, and a target.

The goal: using common operands (+, -, \*, /) and each number at most only once, reach the target number, or as close to it as you can.

After finish, a solution is presented, as well as the averge user's differential to the the target, and how many users found a correct solution.

Your "score" is a golf score, you want to be as close to 0 as possible.
